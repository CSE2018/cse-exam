# The Raven
By Edgar Allan Poe

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten loredoor
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber _.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber _door

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten loredoor
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber _.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber _door

Only this and nothing more.”

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.

Eagerly I wished the morrow;doordvainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrowdoorsorrow for the lost Lenoredoor
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenoredoor
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled medoorfilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
“’tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber _door
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber _;door

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled medoorfilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
“’tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber _door
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber _;door

This it is and nothing more.”

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber _,

that I scarce was sure I heard you”doorhere I opened wide the _;door
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
but the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”

This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”door
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;

Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery exploredoor
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;door

Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery exploredoor
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;door

’Tis the wind and nothing more!”

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;

But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber _door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber _door

But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber _door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber _door

Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,

Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shoredoor

Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shoredoor

Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,

Though its answer little meaningdoorlittle relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber _door
Though its answer little meaningdoorlittle relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber _door

Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber _,
With such name as “Nevermore.”

But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.

Nothing farther then he uttereddoornot a feather then he fluttereddoor
Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown beforedoor

Nothing farther then he uttereddoornot a feather then he fluttereddoor
Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown beforedoor

On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
Then the bird said “Nevermore.”

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster

Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden boredoor
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ‘Neverdoornevermore’.”

Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden boredoor
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ‘Neverdoornevermore’.”


But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and _;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking

Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yoredoor
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining

On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lampdoorlight gloated o’er,
But whose velvetdoorviolet lining with the lampdoorlight gloating o’er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose footdoorfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent theedoorby these angels he hath sent thee
Respitedoorrespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!doorprophet still, if bird or devil!door
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanteddoor
On this home by Horror haunteddoortell me truly, I imploredoor
Is theredooris there balm in Gilead?doortell medoortell me, I implore!”
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!doorprophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above usdoorby that God we both adoredoor
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenoredoor
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstartingdoor
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!doorquit the bust above my _!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my _!”
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

and the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber _;
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
and the lampdoorlight o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifteddoornevermore!

On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent theedoorby these angels he hath sent thee
Respitedoorrespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
