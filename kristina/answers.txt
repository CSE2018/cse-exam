  git branch -r gives me  all branches,  include  remote

1. How many commits are in this repository (in total; in all branches)?

git shortlog -n -s --all
    58  Stepan Bolotnikov
     7  Ako
     7  AndresKKuura
     1  AkoTonissoo
     1  FrediArro
     1  Kristen Kotkas
     1  karlmeldorf

Answer: in total 76 commits  

Data from Github
In master - 29 commits
Easiest way to me know how much  in  each  branch is  to  copy  from Github /branches  when
I can see how  much  was  before  master and  after
I made  a copy  from  these:
